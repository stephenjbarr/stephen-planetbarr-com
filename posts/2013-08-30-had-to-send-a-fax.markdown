Yesterday, I was dealing with an institution in another company that required a signed document. They required that this document be [faxed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax). This technology is from the late 1800's, and solved the problem of moving documents across great distances for a long time. However, there is [a much better way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). I went to a local FedEx (formerly FedEx Kinko's, formerly Kinko's) to send the fax and they charged $5.99 to transmit this one page of text halfway across the globe. 

Just for comparison, I pay about $30 per month for a 25 megabit connection. I could stream HD video across the globe for an entire month for $30. And yet, at FedEx, I would be able to fax about 7 pages of text for this price ( $$price = 5.99 + 3.99(x-1)$$ ). 7 pages would make a 10KB pdf. Assuming 4GB per hour, a month of 720p HD video would be about 2.81 terabytes. This makes sending a fax approximately 300 million times more expensive than using the internet.
