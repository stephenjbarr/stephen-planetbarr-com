I was taking a break after coming home from campus today and stumbled upon an interesting wikipedia article on the Kardashev scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale). This scale measures a civilization's technological advancement based on the amount of energy they have been able to harvest. The scale seems to be: type I - a civilization similar to humankind's current consumption, type II - a civilization that harnesses a large portion of the energy of it's own star, type III - a civilization harnessing the energy of it's own galaxy, type IV - a civilization that can consume the energy of the entire universe. You can read Kardashev's original 1964 [article here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1964SvA.....8..217K)

These 4 types encompassed the original Kardashev scale. It has since been extended as we have been able to think about concepts larger than one universe. What sounded particularly interesting was the type IV civilizations, which are "capable of intergalactic travel, intergalactic communication, and universal-scale influence". The [type IV subsection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#Type_IV) of the wikipedia article then lists mentions several books and other works of fiction that mention type-IV civilizations. Aside from The Last Question by Asimov, I haven't read any of them. [*Dancers at the End of Time*](http://www.amazon.com/Dancers-End-Time-S-F-Masterworks/dp/0575074760/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1349306443&sr=1-1&keywords=the+dancers+at+the+end+of+time) sounded particularly interesting.
