As a preparation for my course work, I wanted to get a good survey of the operations management literature. After some searching, I found the [*Operations Research and Management Science Handbook*](http://www.amazon.com/Operations-Research-Management-Science-Handbook/dp/0849397219/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1345966432&sr=8-1&keywords=operations+research+and+management+science+handbook), edited by [A. Ravi Ravindran](http://www.informs.org/Connect-with-People/Speakers-Program/Search-for-a-Speaker/Search-by-Location/Northeast-U.S./Ravindran-A.-Ravi-PhD-Penn-State-University).

There are 24 chapters with the following topics and two broad sections:

**OR/MS Models and Methods**

1. Linear Programming
2. Nonlinear Programming
3. Integer Programming
4. Network Optimization
5. Multiple Criteria Decision Making
6. Decision Analysis
7. Dynamic Programming
8. Stochastic Processes
9. Queueing Theory
10. Inventory Control
11. Complexity and Large-Scale Networks
12. Simulation
13. Metaheuristics for Discrete Optimization Problems
14. Robust Optimization

**OR/MS Applications**

15. Project Management
16. Quality Control
17. Reliability
18. Production Systems
19. Energy Systems
20. Airline Optimization
21. Financial Engineering
22. Supply Chain Management
23. E-Commerce
24. Water Resources
25. Military Applications
26. Future of OR/MS Applications: A Practitionerâ€™s Perspective

I am reading through one chapter per day, and I will publish a little example where appropriate. The book is a bit expensive to buy a hard copy, but the [UW library](http://lib.washington.edu/) had a digital copy in the form of PDFs. The book seems to be very useful and I am enjoying working through it. It is published by [CRC Press](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9780849397219).
