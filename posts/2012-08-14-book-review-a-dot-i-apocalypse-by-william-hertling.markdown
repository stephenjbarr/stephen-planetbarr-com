['A.I. Apocalypse'](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FZVI2M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=liquididea-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007FZVI2M) is the second of three books in the singularity series by [William Hertling](http://www.williamhertling.com/). The idea of a [technological singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) is that, once computers learn how to make themselves smarter, an iterative process will start whereby computers repeatedly build smarter and smarter versions of themselves until their intelligence rivals or surpasses the intelligence of the humans. At that point, hopefully things go peacefully with regards to computer/human relations. The classic fear in this situation is that the computers "see humans as a threat".

The universe of 'A.I. Apocalypse' is set perhaps 15 years in the future. The potential, in terms of computer power and worldwide network bandwidth, is there for an intelligence to exists. The book shows the creation of such an intelligence, and does a fantastic job demonstrating the speed of the evolution of an artificial intelligence. The level of tech detail is enough to be plausible, without being distracting. Although not strictkly necessary, you may as well read the first book, ["Avogadro Corp: The Singularity is Closer Than It Appears"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ACIMQQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=liquididea-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B006ACIMQQ), first. I am looking forward to the 3rd one.
