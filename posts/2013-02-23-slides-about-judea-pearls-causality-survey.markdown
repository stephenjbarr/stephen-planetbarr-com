I recently had the opportunity to a [survey](http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r350.pdf) paper by [Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html). His work on causality provides researchers with a mathematically rigorous way of estimating causal quantities from non-experimental data. He is greatly respected in the computer science and machine learning communities. I would recommend watching one of his [lectures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78EmmdfOcI8). His slides, [Reasoning with Cause and Effect](http://singapore.cs.ucla.edu/IJCAI99/index.html), are also quite good. Pearl also wrote an amazing book entitled [Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference](http://www.amazon.com/Causality-Reasoning-Inference-Judea-Pearl/dp/052189560X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361648912&sr=8-1&keywords=causality+judea+pearl). In addition, his son, Daniel Pearl, was brutally murdered by terrorists and Judea has chosen to [honor his son's memory by fostering dialog](http://www.danielpearl.org/). He is a remarkable individual and it was a real pleasure studying his work.
