## Last update: 2012-08-20 22:59
This post will be continually updated to reflect my current setup and preferences.

## 1) Inspiration
  This is my personal "The Setup" page, modeled after the official [The Setup] blog.

## 2) Who are you and what do you do?
  My name is Stephen J. Barr. I do economics research, particularly in the field of operations management. My prior graduate work was in business economics and applied statistics.

## 3) What hardware are you using?
  My development workstation is a [Thinkmate] [HPX XS8-2462], with dual 6-core Xeon Sandy Bridge-EP 2620 CPUs, an NVidia Quadro 600 GPU, 64 GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD. It is absurdly fast, reasonably quiet, and the build quality and reliability are fantastic. The hardware was designed to mimic Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud's [CC2.8xlarge]. The CC2's have more cores (32 (hyperthreaded) vs my 24 (also hyperthreaded)), a bit less RAM, but are for the most part identical. This allows me to develop highly optimized code locally, specifically optimized for Intel's [Advanced Vector Extensions] (new on the Sandy Bridge-EP's) and move the binaries right to EC2. In essence, my development box is also node 0 of an infinitelyscalable cluster of CC2's. 

The box is connected to two 22" [Acer Monitors]. One is a glossy X222W and the other is a matte AL2216Wbd. They are balanced on some old textbooks to get the height about right. For a keyboard, I have the [Rosewill RK-9000 with Cherry Blue] keys. This was after years with a [Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro 4000]. I really like being able to pound on the keys, so they cherry blue keys are a good fit for that. The mouse is a [Logitech G400]. I like the weight of it. Interestingly, I use the mouse left handed since my [Dad] is left handed, and that is how the computer was set up when I first approached it. I assumed that that is where the mouse goes, and now I have adapted and prefer it on the left. 

When I am mobile, my laptop is an [HP DV7t laptop]. The 17" screen is fun to work on, and I like the full size keyboard. It seems to get hot while running, so if it around the house I keep it on a [Cooler Master Notepal X2]. Anyone who has a laptop should have one of these. I also have a [Motorola Droid 3] which I like but am underutilizing. I get a ton of use out of my [Amazon Kindle Touch]. It is nice to use and I read a lot more, both for work and pleasure. It is nice to read papers and documentation on the kindle, although it can sometimes mangle tables and equations. When listening to music, I use [Sennheiser HD201 headphones] or an set of Caimbridge FPS2000 speakers I bought when I was a teenager but still produce great sound. I am watching for the [Kindle Fire 2](http://www.techradar.com/us/news/mobile-computing/tablets/amazon-kindle-fire-2-release-date-news-and-rumours-1043361) and will probably get one when it comes out.

  For the non-electronic hardware, I usually use [National Brand Computation Notebooks]. I like the color, thickness, and size of the pages. My pen of choice is the [Pilot Precise Grip, Bold Point]. They work well with the lab notebooks. I don't like fine-point pens unless the ink is extremely dark. I
try to sit on my 75cm yoga ball. My desk is a fantastic [Ikea Galant](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99806947/). It is attactive, large, and extremely well built. I would have no problem standing on it to change a lightbulb. At some point I will probably get an extension for one of the sides.

## 4) And what software?
The majority of my time is spent in [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), as that works for writing code, papers, plotting, and most other ways I interact with a computer. A few years ago I decided that I would always try to invest some time into learning my tools, and that tool has mostly been Emacs. To mention some specific Emacs modes, I use [AuCTeX] and [RefTeX] mode for authoring papers, [org-mode] for TODO lists and READMEs, [org2blog] to publish blog posts and pages (including this one), ECB for navigating projects, erc for IRC chat, gtags-mode with GNU Global for finding stuff, cua-mode for rectangular text manipulations, and probably a many other modes. Conkeror is a Firefox-based web browser which has Emacs-like keyboard shortcuts and a REPL. My operating system of choice is Ubuntu Linux using Gnome3. I don't understand all of the negative press about Unity, but I prefer Gnome3. I like the concept of being able to make an infinitely long stack of new workspaces.   I write a lot of code as well. The numerical stuff is done in C++, and I use a set of templates called [Eigen] for working with matrices. Eigen is fantastic because it can link against Intel's [MKL], which has optimized versions of BLAS and LAPACK for playing with matrices. <!-- After I develop, I use [EC2] to get the work done. My typical framework is: -->

<!--   * write a binary which solves a model for one set of parameters -->
<!--   * take parameters over the command line -->
<!--   * solve -->
<!--   * simulate based on those parameters -->
<!--   * collect statistics based on the simulation -->
<!--   * dump these statistics to a CSV file -->

<!--   To run this binary over many different sets of parameters in parallel, I -->
<!-- have Python scripts that submit tasks to an [SQS] queue. I have a bootstrap -->
<!-- script that my EC2 instances use that do the following: -->

<!--   * get the lastest binary from [S3] -->
<!--   * check the SQS queue -->
<!--   * If a task is there, solve it -->
<!--   * Push results to S3 -->
<!--   * If there are a few consecutive reads with no tasks, shut down -->

<!--   This is a simple setup but I have performed run tens of thousands of tasks -->
<!-- this way and it seems to work. -->

<!--   I store my code in [Bitbucket], mostly using mercurial but I am learning -->
<!-- git. Before checking in, I use [kdiff3] to see what changed. --> 

I use the optimization routines in the [GNU Scientific Library].  I use R very often for processing and plotting the results of my simulations. For plotting, I use [ggplot2](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/). My Summer 2012 project is to teach myself GPU programming in CUDA. I use the Intel C/C++ compilers as well as [Intel Parallel Studio XE] (specifically VTune Amplifier) to make sure I am getting full utilization out of all cores. To use all of the cores, I use OpenMP.   My music comes in on [Spotify] or occasionally [Pandora].

## 5) What would be your dream setup?
At some point I think I would like a wireless mouse. Unlimited [AWS] credit would be cool. At some point in the future, I would like to hire some ergonomics consultant to help place my monitors and desk in a way that I minimize fatigue. Otherwise, I think I am quite close to my dream setup.
