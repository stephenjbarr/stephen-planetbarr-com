A new book, "Homotopy Type Theory - Univalent Foundations of Mathematics", was recently released. The book was collaboratively developed and the $$\LaTeX$$ source is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/HoTT/book). Andrej Bauer has a [blog post describing how the book came together](http://math.andrej.com/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/). Download the [PDF of the book](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Hott-online.pdf). I hope to have the time to browse through this on a quiet Sunday afternoon at some point in the next few months.
