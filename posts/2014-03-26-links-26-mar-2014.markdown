The following are a few links of things that have been on my radar.


# 2048

Just over 2 weeks ago, the game 2048 was released.
It is very interesting and slightly addicting, and definitely worth a look.
A few people have tried to make solvers using different attempts.
At some point I would like to try making a deep neural network solver for this.

- [One 2048 AI](https://github.com/ov3y/2048-AI), which uses minimax search and $$\alpha-\beta$$ pruning (see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning))

- [Hulk: An IRC Server in Haskell](http://chrisdone.com/posts/hulk-haskell-irc-server) - IRC is extremely useful. #haskell on Freenode is a very nice community and I have received many good suggestions from the people there.
- [Structured Haskell Mode](https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode) - I need to give this a try
