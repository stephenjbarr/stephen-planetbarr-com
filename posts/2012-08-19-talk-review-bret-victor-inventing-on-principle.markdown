I enjoy listening to talks. TED talks. Conference talks. They are a great medium for communicating. I recently had playing the talk ['Inventing on Principle' by Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/). He believes strongly that technologists and researchers (operations research included) are, at heart, creators, just as much as artists are creators. However, unlike artists, rather than using paint or other physical medium, we create using math, computers, simulations, etc. Bret's objective, or as he would say, his "social cause" towards which he is working, is to have digital creators have environments where the feedback is immediate. This is in contrast to the write->compile->execute->check output->edit cycle that is typical when using a computer for research


The talk is good, and his passion for his research comes through. The first talk demonstrates ways in which the digital creative process can be more responsive and streamlined. The latter half of the talk is more philosophical. He says that there are many things in society that are "wrong", but from our perspective, they are just the way things are done. He cites women's suffrage as an example. Bret strongly believes that the way we interact with computers is wrong in the sense that is much unrealized potential. Rather than simply point out this shortcoming, he is trying to improve this process.

From my perspective as a researcher, it is always important to question "Why do we do things the way we do? Is it the best way, or is there a better one? Is our steady state the global optimum, or are we stuck in a low equilibrium?" Business research is interesting, because there is unlimited potential.

Definitely give this talk a listen.
