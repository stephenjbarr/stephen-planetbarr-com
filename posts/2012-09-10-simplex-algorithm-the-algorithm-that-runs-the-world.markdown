The CCC blog](http://www.cccblog.org/2012/08/20/the-algorithm-that-runs-the-world/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+cccblog%2FwDnv+%28CCC+Blog%29) recently highlighted an article from [The New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528771.100-the-algorithm-that-runs-the-world.html?full=true) entitiled ["The Algorithm that Runs the World"](http://www.cccblog.org/2012/08/20/the-algorithm-that-runs-the-world/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+cccblog%2FwDnv+%28CCC+Blog%29). They were referring to the simplex algorithm, an algorithm for solving linear programs. It is a good read, and I would highly recommend it. I learned about the simplex algorithm from the late UW professor [Paul Tseng](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tseng). He was a great man and I wish he was still with us
