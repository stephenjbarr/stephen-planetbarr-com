I still have a few weeks before my official UW course work begins, so I am taking a [machine learning](https://class.coursera.org/ml-2012-002/class/index) course through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The course consists of video lectures and some exercises. I am looking forward to working through it while I have this available time.

Machine learning is useful in the sense that it can produce good, although not provably optimal, solutions to problems where the state space is too  large to be solved with more traditional dynamic programming techniques. It is also useful for building heuristic models based on correlations in the data.

I am looking forward to seeing how it goes.
