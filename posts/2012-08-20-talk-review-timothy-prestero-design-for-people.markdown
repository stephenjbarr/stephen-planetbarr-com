I had the TED talk by Timothy Prestero called *Design for people, not awards*](http://www.ted.com/talks/timothy_prestero_design_for_people_not_awards.html) on today. Timothy is a products designer who wants to design medical equipment to help children in developing countries. His talk centers on his attempt to design an incubator for children. They designed a beautiful, award winning, functional incubator. However, it had a large problem - it was not feasible to produce and distribute

From an operations management perspective, the following quotes were interesting

<blockquote>
It turns out there's this whole constellation of people involved in a product for it to be successful. Manufacturing, financing, distribution, regulation.
</blockquote>

Later in the talk,

<blockquote>
So, I was thinking about, what I really want to do is change the world. I have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution...I actually have to pay attention. Really, there's no excuse for failure.
</blockquote>



These quotes have a nice relation to the definition of [*operations management*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_management).


<blockquote>
Operations management is an area of management concerned with overseeing, designing, controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods and/or services.
</blockquote>

Putting these quotes together, *operations management* is an important field of study because it guides firms in the creation and distribution of goods efficiently and effectively, which can have a positive impact on the welfare of people.
