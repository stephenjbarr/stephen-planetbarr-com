The [CILVR Lab](http://cilvr.cs.nyu.edu/doku.php?id=courses:bigdata:start) (Computational Intelligence, Learning, Vision, and Robotics) at NYU has a course called **Big Data, Large Scale Machine Learning**. Slides and video lectures are available via [techtalks.tv](http://www.techtalks.tv). The course seems like a good follow-up to introductory courses such as [Andrew Ng's machine learning video lectures](http://videolectures.net/stanfordcs229f07_machine_learning/). I think I will try a few of the exercises in a few weeks. There is always more to learn!
