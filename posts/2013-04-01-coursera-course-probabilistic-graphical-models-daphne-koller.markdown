Next week begins the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) course, *[Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm)* by Professor [Daphne Koller](http://ai.stanford.edu/~koller/) at Stanford. Quoting the course webpage,


**Topics covered include:**

1. The Bayesian network and Markov network representation, including extensions for reasoning over domains that change over time and over domains with a variable number of entities.
2. Reasoning and inference methods, including exact inference (variable elimination, clique trees) and approximate inference (belief propagation message passing, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods).
3. Learning parameters and structure in PGMs.
4. Using a PGM for decision making under uncertainty.

I am hoping to use what I learn here to apply machine learning and data-driven decision making to operations management. As the course progresses, I will update this blog with posts tagged ```pgm```.
