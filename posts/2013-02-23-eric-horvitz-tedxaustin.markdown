His talk does a good job of showcasing his applications of machine learning and decision making under uncertainty to a wide variety of problems ranging from traffic prediction, his automated receptionist, a learning algorithm for when people indend to enter an elevator, and much more. Eric has fantastic ideas for how artificial intelligence will allow computers to copmlement our lives in ways that most of us have yet to imagine.
