I like [[https://news.ycombinator.com/][Hacker News]]. 
It is worth checking to keep up with startups and things that are interesting to that community.
Today there is a new website, [[http://news.startup.ml/][Deep Learning News]], as mentioned by this [[http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/30/of-course-there-is-now-a-hacker-news-for-deep-learning/][VentureBeat article]].
There is also a [[http://www.datatau.com/][Data News]].
