If you use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, you have probably run into the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a> which gives the user the ability to control the various web services from the command line.
When using AWS CLI, it is nice to have different profiles for different projects, clients, and other logical separations that you may want to enfroce.
The way to do this is with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-multiple-profiles">Named Profiles</a>, which allow you to have different access keys and use different regions.
To use the profile, you need to to append <code>--profile myprofilename</code> to the end of each aws command.
This gets tedious, and a good fix for this is <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/aliases.html">bash aliases</a>.

<p>
In your <code>.bashrc</code> file (at the root of your home directory in Linux and probably OSX), you can add the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #006FE0;">alias</span> <span style="color: #BA36A5;">awsth</span>=<span style="color: #008000;">'aws --profile=th'</span>
<span style="color: #006FE0;">alias</span> <span style="color: #BA36A5;">awslp</span>=<span style="color: #008000;">'aws --profile=sjblaptop'</span>
<span style="color: #006FE0;">alias</span> <span style="color: #BA36A5;">awsai</span>=<span style="color: #008000;">'aws --profile=sjbai1'</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then, rather than using <code>aws --profile=sjblaptop s3 cp...</code>, I can use <code>awslp s3 ...</code>.
