I was doing some web searching while working on some dynamic programming and found that there is a documentary](http://www.bellmanequation.com/pages/screenings.html) movie called [The Bellman Equation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1785593/). It was made by [Richard Bellman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Bellman)'s grandson, Gabriel Bellman. I'll have to get a copy and watch it over the course of a few bus rides
