My father-in-law in Australia likes to read the newspaper. His favorites are The Economics, the [Sydney Morning Herald](http://www.smh.com.au/) (SMH), and [The Australian](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/). He saves the articles and gives them to me to read when I am there. One particularly interesting article that he gave me was from the SMH, entitled [Why the finance world needs a biology lesson](http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac;jsessionid=40220A20533289AD165F2C63DA5BC795?sy=afr&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=1month&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=brs&cls=17630&clsPage=1&docID=SMH120712113D46GLKGC). 

The main idea of the article was that the world financial system is not very resilient, as shown by the recent financial crisis (or GFC (Global Financial Crisis) as the Australians refer to it). Part of this lack of resilience can come from the fact that the financial system is very flat, in that everything has the potential to be linked to everything else, especially through the use of complex derivatives. In biology, there are hierarchical systems - self contained units. The main hypothesis seems to be that in biology, the hierarchy exists so that damage to one system is mostly absorbed in that one system, making the body as a whole resilient. 

I thought that the article was interesting, but there was definitely room for the analogy between the financial system and biological systems to be strengthened. The author, [Mark Buchanan](http://www.bloomberg.com/view/bios/mark-buchanan/), is a theoretical physicist and writes for Bloomberg. One reference I did really appreciate in the article is a reference to [Herbert Simon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon), who was an economist and artificial intelligence researcher. His work seems very interesting and adds yet more to my "To Read" pile. Of interest seems his 1962 paper, ["The Architecture of Complexity"](http://ecoplexity.org/files/uploads/Simon.pdf). The reading is relevant to us in operations, as resilience can be an important part of network design.
