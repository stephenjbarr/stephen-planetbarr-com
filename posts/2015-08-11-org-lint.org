* Use org-lint to clean your org-mode files

I organize my tasks with Emacs [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode.]]
As a side project, I have been working on parsing my org files to perform analytics.
It would be possible to do this in Emacs lisp, but I would like to have flexibility to do this in [[https://github.com/digitalmentat/orgmode-parse/issues/13][Haskell]] or R.
As part of this, I want to make sure that the my org-files are properly formatted.

To do this, you can use [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/96989][org-lint]].
To get this running, you need to:

1. Clone the org-mode git repository
2. Switch to the =wp-lint= branch
3. Build org-mode
4. Start Emacs using this branch
5. Open a =.org= file and use =M-x org-lint= to fix


To do this:

#+NAME: shell-cmds
#+begin_src sh
mkdir -p ~/emacs-dev
cd ~/emacs-dev
git clone orgmode@orgmode.org:org-mode.git
git checkout wp-lint
cd org-mode
make
emacs -Q -L lisp/
#+end_src
