[David Barber](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) is a computer scientist at University College London. He does interesting research in machine learning, Bayesian statistics, Markov decision processes, and other very interesting topics. I discovered him while browsing books on [Amazon.com](www.amazon.com). He teaches a course on [machine learning and computational statistics](http://www.csml.ucl.ac.uk/courses/msc_csml/). Last but not least, he authored the book ["Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning"](http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Reasoning-Machine-Learning-Barber/dp/0521518148/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1358122559&sr=8-2&keywords=bayesian+reasoning+and+machine+learning). It have spent a bit of time with it and it is well written and beautifully typeset. A [PDF is free to download](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.Online) from his website.
