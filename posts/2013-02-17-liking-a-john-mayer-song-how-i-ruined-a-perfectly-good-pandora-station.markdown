I was discussing with one of my UW [TMMBA](http://www.foster.washington.edu/academic/tmmba/Pages/TMMBAHome.aspx) students about machine learning, and I related an incident where I had a perfectly crafted [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/) station. Pandora, is an internet-based streaming music service which aims to provide you a perfect radio station. You provide feedback to Pandroa by "liking" or "disliking" songs, and Pandora responds modifying the radio station based on these preferences.

To continue with the story, I was listening to my perfect station when drew from the far left tail of some probability distribution and played a [John Mayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayer) song. John Mayer is not my kind of music. He sings soft sappy acousic rock. Not really my style. But, for whatever reason that day I thought that one of his songs was catchy and I pressed "Like". Big mistake.

I completely ruined my station. The station seemed to alternate between "[Waiting on the World to Change](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBIxScJ5rlY)" and "[Somewhere Over the Rainbow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bFr2SWP1I)". Pandora needs to have an "un-like" feature where you can adjust the mix of songs that Pandora is using as its training set. See [an interesting interview with Eric Bieschke](http://bickson.blogspot.com/2011/09/spotlight-pandora-internet-radio.html), director of playlist engineering at Pandora.
