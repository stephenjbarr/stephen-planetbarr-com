I recently had the pleasure of attending a talk by [Eric Brill](http://labs.ebay.com/people/eric-brill/), Vice President of Research at Ebay. His talk was a non-technical talk, focusing on his ideas of how to have an exciting, enjoyable, and successful career. It was a very motivating talk. His main idea was that it is entirely up to the individual to take charge of their own life, and make the best career for themselves. The most important thing one can do with regards to their career is to be deterministic. "Drift is the biggest enemy of all of us."

Also, he suggested that it was extremely important to be obsessed with self-improvement, and to take feedback. This matches my anecdotal evidence that very successful people are constantly seeking honest feedback for the purpose of self-improvement.
