[Harvest Automation Brings Affordable Robotics to Big Ag](http://singularityhub.com/2013/09/02/harvest-automation-brings-affordable-robotics-to-big-ag/) - This is really cool! I think that the possibilities for robotics in agriculture is amazing. Although the firm is not working on a robot that "detects ripe fruit and picks it", that seems to be one of the long term goals in this field (no pun intended).

One clear advantage of robotic farming is that food can be farmed in a [permaculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture). It seems that plants grow much better not in clean, homogeneous columns, but in a more enmeshed arrangement. Permaculture allows for much more [crop density](http://deepgreenpermaculture.com/backyard-orchard-culture/), and thus more efficient land usage. I can imagine farms completely controlled by autonomous robots. Perhaps there would be solar-powered robots that permanently reside in the fields, monitoring properties of the soil (humidity, acidity, nitrogen content) every meter. Each berry, squash, and tomato can be assigned its own [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier), monitored daily, and picked at nutritional optimality. The field-bots can have a limited local storage, and autonomous storage blimps can continually pick up the produce from the field-bots, bring them to buildings where they can be washed, processed, and shipped (autonomously of course) to local markets.
