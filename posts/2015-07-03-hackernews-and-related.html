I like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. 
It is worth checking to keep up with startups and things that are interesting to that community.
Today there is a new website, <a href="http://news.startup.ml/">Deep Learning News</a>, as mentioned by this <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/30/of-course-there-is-now-a-hacker-news-for-deep-learning/">VentureBeat article</a>.
There is also a <a href="http://www.datatau.com/">Data News</a>.
