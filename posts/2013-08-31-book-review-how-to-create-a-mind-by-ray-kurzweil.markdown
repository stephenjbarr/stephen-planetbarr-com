I recently finished [How to Create a Mind](http://howtocreateamind.com/) (HCM) by [Ray Kurzweil](http://kurzweilai.net/). In HCM, Kurzweil presents his pattern recognition theory of mind (PRTM), which he describes as *the basic algorithm of the neocortex*. The key idea is that there are regular structures called "pattern recognizers" in the neocortex arranged in a hierarchical manner. When a pattern is recognized, there is both upstream and downstream feedback throughout the hierarchy. For example, the recognizer for a part of a printed letter fires up the hierarchy to increase the probability that the full letter is accepted, and also down the hierarchy to put on alert the pattern recognizers for words containing that letter.

I like Kurzweil's style of writing because it is extremely optimistic, and speaks of the human mind's ability to solve any problem, specifically by being able to create machines that are both smarter than ourselves, and smart enough to create even smarter versions of themselves. I highly recommend this book. [Buy it on Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/0143124048/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1377995534&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+create+a+mind)

As some follow up research on a more technical level, I sourced a copy of [Pattern Calculus](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-89185-7/page/1) from the UW library, as well as [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/PRML/index.htm). I am looking forward to looking through those resources.
