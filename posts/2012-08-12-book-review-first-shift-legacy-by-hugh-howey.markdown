Welcome to the first of my book reviews. Although this blog is mainly about my research, it is also about things that are interesting to me. And, one of those things are books. I enjoy reading, mainly science fiction. The first book I would like to review is *First Shift, Legacy* by Hugh Howey][Hugh Howey's Website]

To appreciate the *First Shift*, you need to read the [Wool series][omnibus], a set of five small books by Hugh Howie about a dystopian world in which the world has become toxic and humanity lives underground in a multistory structure referred to as a *silo*. These are fantastic books and if you haven't read those, stop reading this post and read those first. I do not want to spoil anything. 

Dystopia is interesting because they are mental experiments concerning the future of humanity. The author's role in writing these books is to make the reader think that, although extreme, such a future is possible given the wrong set of choices. However, what is often left out is the backstory - how did this fictional humanity get to such a state? *First Shift* begins to answer that question. 

In terms of writing, *First Shift* does not disappoint. In terms of story, it is even better. The book starts as two stories separated through an unknown number of years, pre- and post- silo. For these stories to converge takes the entire book, and along the way you learn how the silo was designed, and to some extent what their intended use was.

Go ahead and read *First Shift*. You will definitely enjoy it.
